Japan was in dire straits and attempted to reconcile by sending a bribe to the Ming Dynasty general, but Yi Sun-sin opposed this, and the following year, on August 18 of the lunar calendar, Toyotomi Hideyoshi (豐臣秀吉) died, and the Japanese army withdrew, leaving a will to withdraw just before his death.
